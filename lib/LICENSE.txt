In this directory, the file "elisa-spritesheet1.png" was made by
Jetrel, who placed it into the public domain via the CC0 license. It
was obtained from <http://opengameart.org/content/castle-platformer>
on September 21, 2013.

In 2013, I, Ross Angle, derived the file
"elisa-spritesheet1-transparent.png" from "elisa-spritesheet1.png" by
replacing the background color with full transparency. I release this
file under the CC0 license.
